Alternate method (non-regex)

-First, separate function based on parentheses to ensure that I don't dismantle a trigonometric, or logarithmic function.  Do this recursively to account for nested parentheses.  Ignore division, trig, and logs until later.
-Secondly, separate the functions within the parentheses at any addition or subtraction point.
-Thirdly, derive these separate functions using the various rules of derivatives.
-Lastly, recombine the functions to display the derivative.



func Parentheses

  for each character, move through string
    when encountered open parenthese, modify an array or stack (bool?).  When a closed parenthese is met, pop the stack.  When the stack is empty, a full sub-function is contained.
    recursively call this function with the substring.
    Ensure that we do not mess up trig or logs.
  
  Separate this string
  Run exponents
  Run multiplication/divison
  Run trig/logs/e
  
    

    
func Separate

  find + or -, run the substrings back through the system.
  
func exponents
 
  find instances of x^n, transform them.
  
 func multi/division
 
  find instances of multiplication or division, derive their factors, then derive the expression
  
func trig/logs/e
 
  transform trig and log functions to the appropriate value, leave e^x alone.
  
  

  
But BEFORE ALL

  Ensure input works properly, create test function.
